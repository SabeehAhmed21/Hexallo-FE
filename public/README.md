## Hero Image

To add your Venice hero image:

1. Add your image file here (recommended name: `venice-hero.jpg`)
2. The image should be at least 1920px wide for best quality
3. The component will automatically use it from `/venice-hero.jpg`

The hero section is configured to use `/venice-hero.jpg` by default. If you use a different filename, update `components/organisms/HeroSection.js`.
